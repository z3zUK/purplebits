# 512kb club entry

This is my contribution to the 512kb project. Just a fun little site to experiment with Grid and some other newish (to me) CSS features. I've managed to prune the code a little since my first attempt, and I think it comes at around 70kb compressed, and 78kb uncompressed. Not too bad, considering there's a 33kb png image plus two imported font weights! Not a single media query either, which pleased me no end. CSS Clamp is an amazing thing!
